There are accessibility and usability issues with CAPTCHA; however, we all hate Spam. This service provides text-based CAPTCHAs easily readable by users with a wide range of accessible technology, using an API provided by textcaptcha.com. Examples of the questions posed by this module are:

* Which word from list "subsiding, tendons, zippy, relationships, octagonal" has "r" as a first letter?
* Hither, oscillator, revulsion: the word containing letter "v" is?
* Twelve - 3 = ?

All that is needed is a free API key, available at:

http://textcaptcha.com/register

The module will also cache challenges after reaching a certain limit so that it can use them in case the textcaptcha.com service is unavailable.
